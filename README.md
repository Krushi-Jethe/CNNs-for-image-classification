# CNNs-for-image-classification


 This particular code which I've written is for the plant seedlings dataset. One would just require to make sure all dependencies have been installed and enter the path 
 where you have downloaded the data.

 This code can be improved by adding a class and various methods within the class for loading data info , image pre-processing and augmentation etc.
